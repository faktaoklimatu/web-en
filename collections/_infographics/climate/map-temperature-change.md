caption:       "The global temperature rise since 1961 is approximately 1.1°C. However, the warming rate is not the same for all locations: while the temperature in most of the planet's oceans has not increased by more than 0.8°C, most of the world's land is warming considerably faster. The highest warming rate on Earth (over 4°C in the last 60 years) is in the Arctic Ocean."
