caption:       "This study by Ember explores how much the Czech electricity generation industry could change by 2030. Specifically, it focuses on the scenario in which all the coal power plants and heating plants in the country are shut down â€“ what would then be the most cost-effective way to build and run new power plants? The study shows that even a very ambitious plan like this one is doable but it would require solar, wind and backup natural gas power plants to be built much faster than they are now."
