caption:       "Historical data as well as future climate models show that global warming is (approximately) directly proportional to the increase of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. More specifically: every time the CO2 concentrations rise by 10 ppm (parts per million), the mean global temperature increases by 0.1Â°C."
