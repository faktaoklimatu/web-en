        <p class="lead">Facts on climate started as a volunteer initiative in 2019 and has become an NGO in October 2020. Throughout the volunteer phase the initiative has created about 40 infographics covering many aspects of climate change (temperature and emissions data, energy, future scenarios, adaptation and mitigation measures) and summaries of selected international reports and studies.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Due to the high visual quality of our work, many of the published materials were adopted by major Czech and Slovak media.

        <p><strong>Our mission is to change how people talk and think about climate change and climate policies.</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Fakta o klimatu aims to change the narrative landscape and enhance the quality of discussion about climate change issues and possible solutions among interested public and policymakers by creating data visualizations related to climate change, energy, emissions etc. and thus anchoring the discussion in facts. These visualizations are further used by journalists and teachers or become part of argumentation for sustainable policies by businesses.</p>
