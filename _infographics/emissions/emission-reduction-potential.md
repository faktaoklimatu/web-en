caption:       "The infographic compares the amount of emissions that can be reduced if people radically change their consumption habits with the amount that can be cut via system changes implemented by the government. The highest potential is in the change of the Czech energy generation mix: shut down the lignite power plants and replace them with energy sources that have lower emission intensity."
