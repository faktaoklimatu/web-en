caption:       "This study by Energynautics explores how much the Czech electricity generation industry could change by 2030. Specifically, it analyzes how the shutdown of coal power plants and their gradual replacement by renewable energy sources would impact the electricity system in the country. The study concludes that the transition from coal to renewables would not be a major problem for the system stability."
