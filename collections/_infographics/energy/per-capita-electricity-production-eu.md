## How to read this graph

* The chart shows **the amount of electricity generated per person by source between 2000 and 2019** in all European Union member states and the UK. Values are given in **<glossary id="w">kWh</glossary> of electricity produced (and consumed) per person per year**.
* Electricity production is also supplemented by average consumption, which **in 2019 across the EU was 6,259 kWh per person**. The chart shows how this average consumption varies across EU member states and how it evolves. The difference between average generation and average consumption represents electricity imports and exports.
* Other fossil fuels primarily include natural gas and renewable sources include solar, wind and hydroelectric power plants, biomass, biogas and waste incineration.
* A similar comparison of electricity production per person from different sources for the world and major regions is provided by the infographic [Electricity production per person in world regions](/infographics/electricity-per-capita-world).

## Comments on the graph

* Electricity represents only a fraction of total energy consumption; for example, most energy used for transport or heating is not included in the graph (as it is direct fossil fuel combustion, not electricity).
* The chart shows significant differences in the amount of electricity produced and consumed between countries. In some cases, these differences can be explained by the different levels of electrification of transport or heating, for example, in Sweden.
* Although coal is only one of the fossil fuels, its combustion releases the most emissions per energy input. For example, natural gas emits only about half the amount of greenhouse gases per unit of energy as coal (especially brown coal). Therefore, it makes sense to show the share of coal as a separate category in the infographic - and so, of course, it is also important to work to reduce the share of coal in electricity generation.
* **Coal's share of electricity generation in the EU has fallen from 30.6% in 2000 to 14.5% in 2019.** Coal has been replaced by renewables (up from 15% to 35.4%), mainly through the development of wind farms. Still, there has also been a significant increase in solar, biomass and waste-based electricity generation. The share of nuclear electricity decreased from 31.4% to 25.6%, while the share of other fossil fuels increased slightly from 23.1% to 24.6% (in particular, the percentage of gas among other fossil fuels increased).
* The decline of coal and its replacement with renewables has significantly improved the carbon intensity of electricity production. In 2000, 450 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> were released in producing 1 kWh of electricity, while in 2019, this amount decreased to only 256 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per 1 kWh of electricity generated.
* Poland has the highest share of coal in electricity generation among EU countries - 74% in 2019 and the Czech Republic was second with 42.6%. However, Poland both produces and consumes significantly less electricity per person than the Czech Republic, comparing absolute values. **The Czech Republic produces the most electricity from coal per person in the EU** - 3,452 kWh per person (Poland is second with 3,152 kWh per person). Only 7 EU countries have a share of coal in electricity generation higher than 15%. By contrast, the lowest shares of coal in electricity generation are in France (more than 70% of electricity is generated from nuclear power plants), Sweden (almost all of its energy is generated from renewable sources - hydro, wind and nuclear), Belgium (a combination of nuclear, renewable and natural gas) and other smaller countries (Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Malta, some of which generate most of their electricity from other fossil fuels).
* Many countries export or import large amounts of electricity, but the EU is practically self-sufficient in electricity (on average, importing only 0.5% of the electricity it consumes).

## Data source

* The base for the infographic is data from the organization [Ember](https://ember-climate.org/) (formerly known as Sandbag). It is an independent climate think-tank focused on supporting the transition from coal to clean sources of electricity. Ember is primarily based on Eurostat data (for 2000–2017); newer data have been supplemented from national and other sources.
* One of the main activities of the Ember think tank is the publication of reports on electricity production in the European Union. In 2020, it also published a report on global electricity production<!--, a summary of which can be found [in studies](/studie/2020-globalni-zprava-o-elektrine)-->.
* Population data is taken from the United Nations.
