All of our materials are under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed) license. This license allows you to use our materials as follows:

* **share** – copy and redistribute the material in any medium and format
* **adapt** – remix, transform and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially,

if you **give appropriate credit**, i.e. mention us as the original author, include the link to our website, provide the license name and the link to the license and indicate if any changes of the infographic were made. Your final product may be visually different, depending on the media where it is used (website, newspaper article, etc.), but the credit must be always there.

When using our infographic, always provide the link to the page with this particular infographic, not the link to the image. An example: _"The [Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Czechia by Sector](/infographics/emissions-czechia) infographic by [Fakta o klimatu](/), licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed)."_

You can also generate the citation directly: click the Share button (with <tt>&lt;/&gt;</tt> symbol) in the "Sharing and license" section on the page with the infographic.
