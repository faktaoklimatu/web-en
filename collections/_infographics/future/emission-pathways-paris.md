caption:       "If we are to keep the rise in mean global temperature below levels that will not cause a large-scale destruction of the environment, we must substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The pathways aiming to limit the increase of global temperature below 1.5°C (above pre-industrial levels) expect human emissions of CO2 to be cut in half by 2030 and net zero to be achieved by 2050. Staying below 2°C would require these emissions to be reduced by 25% by 2030 and net zero to be reached around 2070."
