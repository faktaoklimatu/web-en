caption:       "An overview of electricity generation (by source), related CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions and electricity consumption (by sector). While only 20% of Slovak electricity was produced from coal and natural gas in 2019, these two sources are related to the vast majority of emissions from Slovak energy industry."

## How to read this graph

* The graph below shows the balance of the Slovak electricity sector for the (pre-Covid) year 2019. Looking from the left, we can see the share of each source in electricity production, to which we have assigned the corresponding amount of CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions. On the generation side, electricity imports from abroad also contribute to the overall balance. Similarly, the consumption side, shown to the right of the overall balance, is further divided into electricity exports abroad, losses and net consumption broken down by sector of the national economy.
* At first glance, the graph shows the disparity between electricity production and related emissions at coal-fired power plants and heating plants. They account for 8% of electricity production but produce 44% of all emissions in the electricity sector. If we were to add up the production of coal and gas power plants, we would reach a 20% share of production from fossil sources, which are also responsible for 84% of emissions in the given sector. It should be taken into account that about 75% of electricity production from fossil fuels takes place in thermal power plants (combined production of electricity and heat). **Thus, the decarbonization of the Slovak electricity industry is very closely related to the decarbonization of the Slovak heating industry.**
* Slovakia reduces emissions from the energy sector to some extent by importing electricity (mainly from the Czech Republic and, to a lesser extent, from Poland). Slovakia continues to export most of its total imports, mainly to Hungary. Net imports (1.7 TWh) thus account for only a small part of total electricity imports but still cover 6% of Slovak consumption, corresponding to about 30% of Slovak household consumption.
* The final electricity consumption has been relatively stable in the last 15 years (see [IEA](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-browser?country=SLOVAKIA&fuel=Electricity%20and%20heat&indicator=TotElecCons)). The industry sector has the largest share of consumption (47.1%), followed by trade, services, education and healthcare (25.6%) and households (21.0%).

## Methodology used and origin of data

* To calculate emissions, we used data on gross electricity production according to individual types of power plants or fuels used from the statistical report [Energy 2019](https://slovak.statistics.sk:443/wps/portal?urile=wcm:path:/obsah-sk-pub/publikacie/vsetkypublikacie/92027e17-ae10-424c-87c4-e73038aeb9dc). Based on these data, we subsequently used the relevant coefficients according to the IPCC ([IPCC 2014: ANNEX III, Technology-specific Cost and Performance Parameters](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf)) to calculate the corresponding emissions. We chose the mentioned source, among other things, concerning the unity and availability of data for different types of sources. A similar procedure was used, for example, by the authors of the [ElectricityMap](https://app.electricitymap.org/map) project.
* For simplification and better clarity, we have merged some data. For example, the entry "Biomass power plants" includes production from biomass-fired power plants and electricity production from biogas. The item "Hydroelectric power plants" includes production from hydroelectric and pumped storage power plants, etc.
* The selected emission factors represent the mean value of the _"lifecycle emissions"_, which include the emissions associated with the associated infrastructure required to operate the individual sources. An example of the lifecycle emissions shown in the overview is the non-zero emissions for nuclear power plants.
* The item "Losses" includes the technological self-consumption of energy sources, losses in the network of the transmission system operator, losses in the networks of individual distribution system operators and consumption of pumped storage plants.
