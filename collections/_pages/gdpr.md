### How we process your data when receiving your donation

We process your personal data for the contract performance and for our legitimate interest. When you donate (or pledge to donate) to us, your personal data (first name, surname, place of residence and email address) is added to our database of donors where we also archive the information about the donation amount and frequency. We receive your donation via Darujme.cz, a portal for donors, operated by one of our contractors. This contractor undertakes to use the information that you have provided only as needed to process your donation and conclude the donation agreement. Then the contractor shares this information with our organization. Your bank account number, details of your payment and your credit card details are only shared with the bank performing the transaction.

We process your personal data to comply with our legal obligations (book keeping, issuing donation certificates, and disclosing the total amount of received donations in our Annual Report and other materials) and for our legitimate interest (sending a thank you email to you along with the information how we used your donation; information about our activities and upcoming events; and perhaps a new donation request).

### How we process your data when you register for our workshop or subscribe to our newsletter

We only process your personal data with your consent. If you register for one of our workshops or subscribe to our newsletter, the personal data that you have provided (first name, surname, phone number and email address) will be added to the related database.
