## How to read this graph?

This graph compares indicative estimates of emissions savings in different areas of the company's operations. In the left-hand column, we show the potential for individual savings if a large part of the company were to get involved and collectively halve total consumption in a given category. This emission reduction factor is chosen symbolically; such targets would be very challenging to achieve (and vary in difficulty across categories, see below). For example, halving the distance flown would only save about 0.8% of total emissions compared to 2018.

The right-hand column shows the potential for savings that are not directly related to individual consumption and require a more systemic approach to achieve. For example, planting 10 million extra trees would only save about 0.2% of total emissions in 2030 compared to 2018. In contrast, transforming the energy sector would deliver 50-100 times higher emissions savings.

## Background to the section: What people can influence through their consumption

In this section, we explain in more detail the different estimates and assumptions we make. The exact derivation of each figure can be found in our data table.

### We will drive half the distance in private cars

The largest group of Czech drivers drive between <!--[-->5 and 10 thousand km<!--](https://www.opojisteni.cz/pojistny-trh/pojistne-produkty/pruzkum-pojistovny-direct-jak-cesi-jezdi/c:11746/)--> per year and passenger cars are responsible for a total of 11.9 million tonnes of <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary> emissions in the Czech Republic. **If the total annual mileage were halved, about 5.9 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would be saved annually.**

Such a reduction could be achieved, for example, by even greater use of public transport, less need to commute to work or higher car occupancy. (The average occupancy of cars in the Czech Republic is around 2. In the larger cities, it is 1.3 people per vehicle.) A reduction in passenger car traffic would probably result in a shift of some transport capacity to another category (buses, trains). The amount of emissions saved would therefore be slightly lower than in the above calculation.

### We're flying half the distance

Air transport accounts for around 2.5% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (excluding EWF, see below), but allocating emissions to individual countries is complicated. Most "emissions accounting" calculates emissions by traffic from airports within a given country (for the Czech Republic, especially Prague-RuzynÄ›). In this approach, the emissions of people from the Czech Republic will be slightly underestimated since Czechs also use airports in Vienna or Bratislava. Eurostat reports that emissions from air transport in the Czech Republic in 2018 were 1.25 million tonnes of <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary>. The combustion of aviation gasoline produces not only carbon dioxide but also nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) and sulphur. The release of these emissions high in the atmosphere creates ozone (a greenhouse gas) and condensation trails that must be accounted for in the total radiative forcing of the emissions. This is practically done using the EWF (emission weighting factor). For our calculation, we rely on a [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0168-8) that estimates the mean value of the EWF to be 1.7. **If the population of the Czech Republic flew half the distance, the effective emissions of the Czech Republic would be reduced by 1.1 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq.**


For shorter distances within Europe, planes can be partially replaced by train services, but for long flights, it is difficult to imagine a substitute. Technologies that would allow air travel with significantly lower emissions are still being tested. However, air transport is currently in crisis due to the COVID-19 epidemic and it is possible that the perception of its importance will change in the future.

### We consume half the amount of dairy / meat

According to the Czech Statistical Office, the average Czech eats about 70 kg of meat a year, of which about 6 kg is beef. When all types of meat are included, including the distinction between dairy and beef cattle, the emissions related to meat consumption in the Czech Republic total 6.8 million tonnes of <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary>. This figure includes the entire production cycle, i.e. it includes, for example, feed and transport to the market. At the same time, we should note that part of the meat production is imported into the Czech Republic. So the value corresponds to the emissions related to the meat consumed, not the meat produced in the Czech Republic. **If people consumed half the amount of meat, 3.4 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions would be saved annually.**

Together, the consumption of milk and milk products can be expressed in terms of the value needed for production. The average consumption is 239 litres of milk per person per year (equivalent to 245 kg). The entire cycle of producing one kg of milk (including feed, methane production, refrigeration, transport, etc.) produces an average of 2.8 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq of greenhouse gas emissions. The total emissions associated with the consumption of milk and dairy products in the Czech Republic are 7.3 million tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>eq. If the Czech Republic's population halved its dairy product consumption, 3.7 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq would be saved.

Many studies suggest that changes in dietary habits could positively impact health, for example, because approximately 71% of men and 57% of women in the <!--[-->Czech Republic are overweight<!--](https://www.ceskovdatech.cz/clanek/85-povolujeme-opasky-cechu-s-nadvahou-vyrazne-pribyva/)-->. Whether changing dietary habits is realistic for a large part of the population is a question beyond the scope of our text.

The emission factors for the entire food production cycle are taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local) and are estimates of world averages. However, the specific emission intensity of milk or meat production in Central Europe compared to, e.g. Brazil is different, which is related to the origin of the feed used, the way land is obtained for grazing or the way manure is handled. The emission factors for meat and milk production in Central Europe can be expected to be lower; therefore, the emission-saving estimates are an upper estimate. Moreover, in practice, the amount of milk or meat saved could be replaced by a plant-based diet, which has a non-zero emission footprint and therefore, the emissions saved would be even slightly lower. Similarly, we should keep in mind that these are estimates of the entire production cycle and therefore include more than just the _agriculture_ sector in Eurostat's emissions statistics.

### We will halve electricity consumption in households

Only about 17% of the electricity produced in the Czech Republic is consumed in households, and at the same time, electricity and heat production produces almost 40% of the Czech Republic's annual emissions. It is appropriate to ask how much of a reduction in emissions would result from saving electricity in households. To make such an estimate, we need to make some assumptions about electricity production, consumption and the electricity market that are not self-evident.

The amount of electricity produced is determined minute by minute by its consumption. Power stations are switched on and off according to demand to avoid voltage drops in the power grid. How the power plants are switched on and off depends mainly on how long it takes to start the plant. Nuclear plants take weeks to start up, coal plants can be up to full power in a matter of hours, and gas or hydroelectric plants, which can switch on and off in minutes, are used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in demand. Wind and solar power plants also contribute to the grid (when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining), and battery or other storage facilities can be expected to play an important role in the future. Another essential factor that determines which sources will produce electricity at any given time is the cost of running the source (for example, solar or wind plants produce virtually free electricity, while coal plants have to pay for coal) and the trading system (renewables have priority access to the grid and long-term guaranteed feed-in tariffs).

**If reduced electricity consumption in households led to the shutdown of gas and coal-fired power plants, then for every kWh saved, about 1 kg of emissions would not be generated.** This value is based on Decree No. 480/2012 Coll. on Energy Audit and Energy Assessment and takes into account that a large part of household electricity is consumed at peak times, which often have to be covered by the most emitting sources of electricity. **A 50% reduction in consumption would therefore result in a saving of 7.6 million tonnes of <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary>.** This is a rather exaggerated estimate of savings, as the real emission intensity for peak operation in 2020 is likely to be slightly lower than that set out in the abovementioned decree.

Most household electricity is used for cooking and heating water (or heating if it is electric). Washing machines and refrigerators use less, and the least amount of electricity is used for lighting. However, electricity provides water heating in about 20% of Czech households and is used for cooking in more than 40% of households<!--(see [CSO statistics](https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/50619982/ENERGO_2015.pdf), Table 1 - 3.3)-->. It is, therefore, questionable whether it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in household consumption. If inefficient boilers and stoves are used for heating, it is desirable to increase consumption to replace them with a heat pump, for example. Some savings could be achieved by preheating water with solar collectors or using surplus electricity from photovoltaic cells. Savings in cooking could be achieved, for example, by using an induction cooker. Replacing conventional light bulbs with LEDs or other more efficient light sources has little effect on electricity consumption.

If the Czech Republic electricity generation transformation in the coming years involves the shutdown of coal-fired power plants, the emission coefficient of peak generation (e.g. using a combination of gas and wind power plants) will be substantially lower than today. As a result, the potential for reducing household electricity consumption will decrease proportionally.

### We halve emissions from heating and water heating

According to Eurostat, domestic combustion caused carbon dioxide emissions of 9.1 Mt <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary> in 2018. Domestic combustion primarily means local heating and water heating, with a small part also made up of cooking with natural gas, but we neglect this.

In addition to direct domestic combustion, heat supplied to households from district heating plants must be added. According to ERO data, heating plants delivered just under 88 TJ of heat to customers in 2018 (more than half from coal and a quarter from natural gas). About 13 TJ of distribution losses and about 6 TJ of self-consumption in heating plants should be added proportionally to this delivered heat. The heating plants emitted 8.4 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq in producing this 107 TJ of heat (this estimate is based on Czech emission coefficients according to the Czech National Institute of Heat and Power). Only about 40% of the heat supplied by the heating plants to their customers went to households. Households are responsible for about 3.3 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq of these emissions.

Heating and hot water for household usages cause emissions of 12.4 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq. **If these emissions were halved, then 6.2 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq would be saved.**

There are tools to reduce emissions: continue insulating buildings, upgrading boilers, reducing hot water consumption and lower temperature requirements in buildings. Nevertheless, such a reduction over 10 years is a very ambitious target. By comparison, emissions in this sector were about twice as high in 1990 as they are today. The primary savings took place in the 1990s and have only fallen by about 10% since 2000. Even the long-term programmes _Green for Savings_ and _New Green for Savings_ did not significantly reduce total emissions.

Note: In the first version of this infographic, we only considered emissions from direct combustion in households, which gave a lower savings potential of 4.6 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq.

### Changing the energy mix

{% include preview-box.html
    title="Energy dependence on coal"
    text="The Czech Republic produces the most electricity per capita from coal in the European comparison."
    slug="coal-phase-out-eu"

Looking at the [greenhouse gas emissions](/infographics/emissions-czechia) in the Czech Republic by sector, it is evident at first glance that the largest share of emissions is attributable to electricity generation. In 2018, it accounted for 39.5% of the Czech Republic's total emissions. The height of this emission percentage is because most electricity in the Czech Republic is still generated by burning lignite. Thus, coal-fired power plants accounted for 47% of electricity generation in 2018 yet produced 88% of all emissions in the sector.

To change the energy mix, we consider 5 scenarios for which we have developed [comparison graphics](/infographics/transition-scenarios-comparison-czechia). Based on the IPCC's full-cycle emission factors for power plants, we estimate greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector for 2018 and individual scenarios in 2030. The estimations include emissions from solar panel production, fossil fuel extraction, etc. Although some of these emissions will be released elsewhere in the world (e.g. in China from the production of solar panels), the calculations reflect the long-term impact of the Czech energy mix on annual global greenhouse gas emissions reasonably accurately.

{% include preview-box.html
    title="Comparison of energy scenarios"
    text="The estimates of emissions in the power sector are based on our comparison of different scenarios for the development of the Czech electricity sector until 2030."
    slug="transition-scenarios-comparison-czechia"
%}

The Czech Republic's [draft](/studies/2019-scenario-necp) National Energy and Climate Plan (**NECP**) of February 2019 expects a gradual increase in the share of renewable energy sources and a related reduction in the emission footprint of the Czech electricity sector. According to this scenario, 1.8 GW of photovoltaic power plants (about +85% compared to the current situation) and 0.7 GW of wind power plants should be installed. If this plan is implemented, **the resulting emissions from electricity generation should fall by around 5.9 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq by 2030**.

Higher savings would be achieved by implementing a [scenario](/studies/2018-scenario-energynautics) developed in 2018 by the German consultancy **Energynautics** on behalf of Czech environmental NGOs. According to this study, which primarily focused on the electricity grid's stability when most coal-fired power plants are shut down, **the resulting emissions would fall by around 16 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq**. The study envisaged replacing the capacity of the decommissioned coal-fired power plants mainly with new photovoltaic (+162 % of installed capacity) and wind (+635 % of installed capacity, equivalent to just under six hundred newly installed wind power plants with a unit capacity of 3 MW). In this case, grid stability would also be supported by new gas-fired power plants (+95 % of installed capacity).

According to the **McKinsey** study, implementing the decarbonisation <!--[-->scenario<!--](/studie/2020-scenar-mckinsey)--> would achieve similar emission savings in the electricity industry. This study models the development in the energy sector, as well as in industry, agriculture, transport and other sectors, looking for the cost-optimal way to decarbonise. In addition to emissions reductions by 2030, it also examines full climate neutrality by 2050. Savings in 2030 are achieved by a similar reduction in coal-fired power generation as in the Energynautics study. Still, compared to that study, McKinsey assumes a more gradual development of solar (+120% of installed capacity) and wind (+230% of installed capacity). The difference in the electricity balance is then offset by imports from abroad.

Even higher emission savings are promised by implementing the [scenario](/studies/2020-scenario-ember) developed by the British climate think-tank **Ember** in 2020. This study examined the feasibility of a complete coal phase-out by 2030. **Phasing out coal would deliver emissions savings in the electricity sector of 28.9 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq.** The study foresees a significant expansion of the installed capacity of photovoltaic power plants (+385%), wind power plants (+1076%), as well as gas-fired power plants and thermal power plants (+242% of installed capacity). However, the increase in electricity generation from natural gas is much smaller (+80%), as these plants serve primarily as a backup source.

The highest emission savings would be achieved if the [scenario](/studies/2020-scenario-bloombergnef) published in November 2020 by **BloombergNEF** were to be implemented. The scenario is part of a study that primarily looks at the possibility of decarbonising the energy sector in EU countries with a high share of fossil fuels and still do not have a set date to shut down coal-fired power plants. The study models the transition to low-carbon energy for Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria. This scenario is based on the assumption of high prices for emission allowances. It does not set emission targets and shows a cost-optimal transformation of the Czech electricity industry. Specifically, it would result in **emission savings of 30.8 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq by 2030**. This scenario mainly involves the development of wind power plants, which should add a total of 6.9 GW of installed capacity (+2100%), equivalent to 2300 wind power plants with a unit capacity of 3 MW. The development of photovoltaics remains roughly at the level of the Ember scenario (see above). The total investment costs for implementing this scenario have been calculated at around EUR 17 billion (slightly over CZK 430 billion, corresponding to around 25% of the state budget expenditure in 2020 or roughly double the estimated cost of the new Dukovany unit).

### Cutting emissions from landfills in half

One of the areas where the Czech Republic's emissions have been increasing since 1990 is waste management. Approximately 2.7 million tonnes of waste end up in landfills yearly, the decomposition of which produces mainly methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The annual greenhouse gas emissions from landfills are equivalent to 3.7 million tonnes of <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary>, which is 80% more than in 1990. If emissions from landfill could be halved, this would save 1.8 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per year.

There are many ways to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. It is possible to create products so they do not generate waste or follow the principles of the circular economy and use unused residues in one production process as raw material for further production. Further potential lies in the increased sorting of bio-waste and its targeted decomposition into biogas or the capture of methane from landfill bodies, which can then be used as fuel.

### Planting 10 million extra trees

Tree planting is seen as an important tool for carbon <glossary id="sequestration">sequestration</glossary>, which is reflected in some policy <!--[-->statements<!--](https://www.facebook.com/AndrejBabis/posts/1636697499800221/)-->. Ten million trees are chosen symbolically (one tree per citizen of the Czech Republic) and also in connection with the same goal of the project Planting the Future, founded by the Partnership Foundation and supported by the Ministry of the Environment. The project aims to plant 10 million new trees outside the forest area by 2025 (i.e. creating new alleys, orchards, thickets, windbreaks, etc.).

According to the latest <!--[-->national forest inventory<!--](http://nil.uhul.cz/)--> conducted in 2011-2015, there are about 2 billion trees in Czech forests (not counting young trees up to 7 cm thick). This amount of trees corresponds to approximately 190 trees per inhabitant.

Planting ten million trees is not unrealistic; in 2019 alone, the Czech Forests planted about 60 million tree seedlings in forests under forest management. Ten million trees would take up about 14,000 hectares (at the density of trees as in an average forest), while about 26,000 hectares of forest have been added in the ten years since the previous forest inventory.

The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered corresponds to the treeâ€™s wood mass increase. The increase per year corresponds approximately to the tree's size (and therefore age). According to available estimates, a mature tree of 70 years can sequester around 150 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. In 2030, such newly planted trees will be at most 10 years old. Small trees of 10 years of age will thus bind significantly less and our optimistic estimate is 25 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per year. **This gives a total estimate of annual sequestration in 2030 of about 0.25 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>.**

However, this estimate is overestimated for several reasons: first, it assumes that none of the trees planted will die within 10 years. Second, it does not consider what happens to the wood of these trees at the end of their lives - if we burn such lumber, much of the stored carbon will be returned to the atmosphere.

Thus, in terms of the need to substantially reduce emissions by 2030 or 2050, maintaining stable, mature forests would bring higher sequestration, i.e. strictly protecting protected areas and expanding areas without intervention.

Of course, carbon sequestration is not the only criterion. Planting new trees outside forests has many other environmental benefits that justify this project very well, although it does not have much impact on the emission reduction potential.

### Sequestration on arable land (change of management)

Agricultural soils naturally fix carbon and the amount of carbon fixed increases or decreases over the years depending on the farming technique chosen. Over the past decades, long-term studies have been carried out in different parts of the world comparing farming techniques according to their sequestration potential. According to a <!--[-->study<!--](https://aa.ecn.cz/img_upload/410697af7dfcb092dfd4e3937dd69e3f/klima_co2_web_final.pdf)--> by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (part of the United Nations), a hectare of land cultivated under organic farming can store around 200 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> annually. When minimum tillage techniques are added, the sequestration potential increases to about 500 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. On depleted soils, this sequestration can be even higher; long-term studies show that the sequestration potential does not decrease much even after 30 years of such farming.

Assuming all Czech fertile land (about 3 million hectares) will be cultivated under organic farming with minimal arable processing, **this land can sequester about 1.5 Mt <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary> per year**.

This estimate does not consider the reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions on farms (as significantly less nitrogen-containing fertilisers are used in organic farming) or the emissions saved by reducing the production of synthetic nitrogen-based fertilisers. The study estimates the potential for these indirect effects to be about half that of soil sequestration, i.e. an additional 0.7 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq per year.

A switch to such a farming regime would lead to a reduction in yields in many areas, so its introduction on 100% of the Czech Republic's arable land is not realistic. However, such a regime has other advantages: better water retention, reduced soil erosion, reduced groundwater pollution (less fertiliser and pesticides), etc.

## Just talk about CO<sub>2</sub>eq?

In this analysis, we simplify the reality by not distinguishing between individual GHGs in the savings potential and only presenting their sum in units of CO<sub>2</sub>eq. In reality, under the emission scenarios (e.g. SR15), the future reduction curves are different for each of the GHGs and so we need to reduce each GHG at a different rate. Anthropogenic emissions of some gases (such as methane and nitrous oxide) cannot be reduced to zero with continued agricultural production and only fall to about half of today's value, even in the most stringent emissions scenarios. For CO<sub>2</sub>, on the other hand, the emission scenarios assume a decrease to negative values, i.e. a significant future deployment of carbon capture technologies. This analysis focuses on the near future, up to 2030. In this timeframe, the emissions scenarios assume similar rates of decline for each gas; therefore, this simplification is appropriate.

## From what whole are the percentages calculated?

The graphic also shows, for reference, the percentage of the measure in relation to the total emissions of **all** greenhouse gases in the Czech Republic in 2018, in units of tonnes of <glossary id="co2eq">CO<sub>2</sub>eq</glossary>. If we were to take only the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by burning fossil fuels as a whole, we could not compare, for example, the emission savings resulting from changing dietary habits, as the methane from beef and dairy production has the largest effect. For comparison with other studies that may relate percentages to a different whole, we can use absolute values of emission savings in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq.
