['Fit for 55'](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0550), a package of legislative proposals that promotes a **reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990**, was presented by the European Commission in July 2021. The package includes both proposals amending existing directives or regulations and entirely new legislative proposals, focusing on emissions trading (EU ETS), carbon offsetting at borders, energy and fuels, and land use and forestry. Last but not least, it brings in supporting measures to make the transition more socially just. The proposed measures should bring new opportunities for investment, innovation and job creation[^fit-for-55].

The package is currently at the stage of legislative proposals by the European Commission, which are being further discussed in the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, i.e. with the participation of ministers of the governments of the Member States and national working groups. In this context, the Czech Republic's **presidency of the Council of the EU**,[^presidency-eu] in the second half of 2022 is crucial, giving the Czech Republic the opportunity to influence the direction of the negotiations. It is expected that negotiations on the final form of the legislation could last until 2024.[^fit-for-55-q-a]

## Context of origin

'Fit for 55' is part of the European Union's (EU) broader strategy to achieve  **<glossary id="carbon-neutrality">Carbon neutrality</glossary>** by 2050, known as the [**European Green Deal**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal).  The European Commission presented the Green Deal in 2019, after which member states agreed on it in 2020. Then, in the summer of 2021, the [**European Climate Law Framework**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R1119) came into force, making the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050 legally binding. This law includes a mid-term target that commits the EU to a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, which the 'Fit for 55' package (loosely translated as "ready for 55%") is designed to ensure.

**To keep global warming below 1.5°C** relative to pre-industrial levels, **we need to halve greenhouse gas emissions globally** (not just within the EU) by 2030. The European Union (EU-27, excluding the UK) accounted for 7.5% of these emissions in 2020. In absolute terms, EU countries produced 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in the same year, ranking third behind China and the US [^emission-co2].

Although the EU and the world are arguably facing the biggest economic and societal transformation in history, according to Eurobarometer data from 2021, the majority of EU citizens (93%) perceive climate change as a serious problem. In the Czech Republic, the figure is over 85%. In addition, 90% of Europeans and 87% of Czechs agree with the statement, "We should reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum while offsetting the remaining emissions, for example, by expanding forest cover to make the EU economy climate neutral by 2050."[^eurobarometer]

## Principles

The following principles permeate the proposed measures in the 'Fit for 55' package:
* **Adequacy and effectiveness of measures** - the proposed measures are based on market mechanisms and regulations.

* **Polluter pays** - firms bear the costs of the emissions they produce, which motivates them to adopt clean technologies. This principle is supported in particular by the emissions trading scheme.<!-- For more information on emission allowances, we recommend our [explainer](/explainers/emisni-povolenky-ets).-->

* **Solidarity** - targeted and systematic support for population groups that may be disproportionately affected by the measures (e.g. energy price increases, loss of employment, etc.).

The individual measures proposed can be divided into three groups. The first group consists of the so-called **market mechanisms**, which include, in particular, the European Union **Emissions Trading Scheme** (EU ETS), where the Commission proposes to include additional sectors (maritime transport, road transport and buildings), the extension of allowances for aviation and a faster reduction of the number of allowances in circulation. At the same time, the Commission provides that Member States will be obliged to use all allowance revenues for climate change measures (previously 50%). The Commission also proposes the introduction of a **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism** (CBAM) to ensure that high-carbon imports are charged. This would apply in particular to, for example, cement or steel, so that importers from third countries would be charged the same emission charges as EU producers. These imports currently account for 2% of all imports. Importers into the EU would therefore have to purchase certificates according to the emissions intensity of the commodities (if they have not already paid them in a third country). The mentioned measures reflect the **polluter pays** principle.

The next set of measures falls under **targets and regulation**, which include a revision of the existing **Renewable Energy Directive**, which would increase their required share of energy generation to 40% by 2030, and the **Energy Efficiency Directive**, which revises the target to reduce primary energy consumption to 39% below expected levels in 2030. Other proposals include **stricter emission regulations for cars and vans**, building **new infrastructure for alternative fuels** and **initiatives for more sustainable aviation fuels** and **cleaner marine fuels**. The package also includes a **revision of the Effort Sharing Regulation**, which increases the target for reducing emissions in sectors outside the EU ETS by 40% by 2030 compared to 2005. In addition, the proposals concern the **EU Forestry Strategy** and the **Revision of the Land Use and Forestry Regulation**. <!--For a more detailed insight into the EU Forestry Strategy, see [our explainer](/explainers/lesnicka-strategie-eu).--> In December 2021, the Commission presented proposals focusing on **the energy performance of buildings**, **the reduction in methane in the energy sector** and **the internal market for renewable gases, natural gas and hydrogen**.

The third group of proposals consists of **support measures**. To ensure a socially just and solidarity-based transition, the Commission proposes the creation of a new **Social Climate Fund**, which will target groups of people who will be more vulnerable due to the economic transition. Part of the fund's income will come from emissions trading revenues and contributions from member states. Solidarity is also directed towards countries with a higher dependence on fossil fuels and lower GDP, for which resources will be available from a strengthened **Modernization and Innovation Fund**.

As the Commission states,[^fit-for-55] the legislative proposals are based on an impact assessment analysis showing that "over-reliance on enhanced regulatory policies would lead to unnecessarily high economic burdens, while carbon pricing alone would not remove persistent market failures and non-market barriers." The package consists of a combination of market mechanisms & regulations and the necessary supporting measures. In most cases, the proposals do not include one specific technology. Generally, they support a range of technologies or only set a target and leave the means of achieving it open.
