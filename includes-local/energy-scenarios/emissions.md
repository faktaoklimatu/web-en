### Greenhouse gas emissions

Most of the studies covered calculate in some way the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the energy sector and what reductions their scenario will achieve in 2030. Such estimates are typically based on emission coefficients, i.e. how many grams of CO<sub>2</sub> (or CO<sub>2</sub>eq) are produced by the gross generation of 1 kWh of electricity. Emission factors are of two kinds:

1. **Direct emissions** include only the operation of the power plant (for fossil sources this is mainly CO<sub>2</sub> emitted during combustion).
2. In addition, **full cycle emissions** include emissions associated with the construction of the power plant and the production of its components (e.g. melting silicon for solar panels), emissions associated with extraction and GHG leakage during extraction and transport of raw materials (e.g. for natural gas).

Savings in GHG emissions produced on Czech territory are best expressed by direct emissions (possibly supplemented by emissions related to coal mining). Such national emissions are compared in many of [our texts](/topics/emissions) and are also covered by the emission targets of the European Union and the Czech Republic.

On the other hand, full-cycle emissions better capture the Czech contribution in the context of global emissions. Climate facts lean towards the latter view for several reasons:

* There is no value in reducing Czech emissions at the cost of significantly increasing emissions elsewhere. Therefore, our metric seeks to capture even such potential increases elsewhere.
* Electricity transformation scenarios are based on significantly increasing the share of renewables, whose direct emissions are almost zero. Direct emissions therefore to some extent disadvantage these sources relative to conventional fossil sources. Full cycle emissions are fairer in this respect.

We therefore use full cycle emission factors, specifically the median values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (see Table A.III.2 in [Annex III](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf#page=7)) to calculate emissions.
