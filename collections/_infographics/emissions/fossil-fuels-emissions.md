## How to read this graph?

* The graph shows **worldwide emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas** and, for comparison, **emissions from cement production**. Total emissions from these sources for 2019 were 35,897 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.
* The graph only shows emissions from the chemical reaction CaCO<sub>3</sub> + heat → CaO + CO<sub>2</sub> as emissions from cement production. Emissions created by burning coal or gas for heating are counted as emissions of the respective fuel.

### Coal

* **Usage:** Primarily for the production of electricity and heat ([Map of world's coal power plants](https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants)) in the iron or glass smelting industry or other heating.
* **Mining and Transportation:** In 2019, the world mined approximately [8 billion tons of coal](https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-information-overview). China (46% of world production) mined by far the most coal, followed by India (10%), the USA (8%), Indonesia (8%) and Australia (6%). Unlike oil and natural gas, which may be transported by pipelines, coal must be brought to the point of consumption by vehicles.
* The graph shows a remarkable **increase in coal consumption after 2000** caused by the industrialization of China, India and other Asian countries. Coal consumption in Europe and the USA has been declining in recent decades.

### Petroleum

* **Usage:** The majority of oil – or, more accurately, the gasoline and diesel produced from oil – is burned in transportation. The use of oil for heating is relatively rare.
* **Extraction and transportation:** The world produces about [100 million barrels of oil](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global_oil.php) daily, or about 5 billion tons per year (2019). Most oil is produced in the countries of the Persian Gulf (about 32% of world production), followed by the USA (15%) and Russia (13%). While the US covers its consumption with production, most other major oil producers export their production. Approximately [61% of crude oil is transported by ship](https://talkbusiness.net/2017/08/61-of-global-crude-oil-and-petroleum-products-transported-by-sea/), with the remainder transported by [pipelines](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/data/geonode:global_oil_pipelines_7z9).
* The graph shows the several-year **decline in consumption after 1979**, caused by the [oil crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_oil_crisis) after the revolution in Iran and the subsequent war between Iran and Iraq. At that time, world production fell by about 4%, and oil prices doubled.

### Gas

* **Usage:** Electricity and heat production in households (heating, cooking, water heating) and industry.
* **Extraction and transportation:** In total, [4000 billion m<sup>3</sup>](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2019-natural-gas.pdf) were extracted in 2019, i.e. about 3.2 billion tons of natural gas. The largest producers include the USA (21% of world production), Russia (17%) and the Gulf States (together 18%). [Transportation of natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas#/media/File:Global_Gas_trade_both_LNG_and_Pipeline.png) occurs through pipelines and ships carrying liquefied gas.
* Burning natural gas is significantly more efficient than burning coal for generating electricity. <glossary id="ipcc">IPCC</glossary> estimates the emission intensity of natural gas in the range of 410-650 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh (including extraction and transport); for coal combustion, it indicates a range of 740-910 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh. This fact represents an important reason for the so-called <glossary id="phase-out">coal phase-out</glossary>, which occurs when a combination of renewable energy sources and gas-fired power plants replaces coal-fired power plants.
* In addition to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from combustion, natural gas extraction and transport also produces methane emissions. These are mainly [gas leaks during mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_emission) estimated at around [100 million tons of CH<sub>4</sub>](https://www.carbonbrief.org/scientists-concerned-by-record-high-global-methane-emissions) per year, equivalent to about a third of anthropogenic methane emissions.

### Cement

* Heating a mixture of limestone and clay to temperatures of around 1450 °C produces cement. Additionally, the heat causes the limestone to decompose into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Approximately half of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cement production arise from the CaCO<sub>3</sub> + heat ⟶ CaO + CO<sub>2</sub> chemical reaction. The other half of the total emissions relates to coal or gas combustion. In the category *cement*, only emissions from the chemical reaction are entered in the graph. The graph includes combustion emissions for the respective fossil fuels.
* Total emissions from cement production (including heating fuels) are approximately 2.8 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, or about 8% of world CO<sub>2</sub> production. If the cement industry were a state, its emissions would be the third largest in the world, after China and the USA.
