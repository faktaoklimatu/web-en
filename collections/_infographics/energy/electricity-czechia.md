## How to read this graph

* The graph below shows the balance of the Czech electricity sector in 2018. Looking from the left, you can see the share of individual sources in electricity production, to which we have assigned the corresponding amount of CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions. Imports of electricity from abroad also contribute to the overall balance on the production side. Similarly, the consumption side, shown to the right of the overall balance, is further divided into electricity exports abroad, losses and net consumption, broken down by sector of the national economy.
* At first glance, the graph shows the disproportion between production and associated emissions for coal-fired and thermal power plants. The latter account for 47% of electricity generation but account for 88% of all emissions in the electricity sector. If we add up the production of coal and gas-fired power plants, we arrive at 54% of the production from fossil sources, but they are also responsible for 96% of the sector's emissions. __The fossil part of the Czech electricity sector thus represents by far the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic across all sectors__, see the [related infographic](/infographics/emissions-czechia).

* Another disparity can be seen between the amount of electricity imported from abroad (11.6 TWh) and the electricity exported to neighbouring countries (25.5 TWh) in 2018. The resulting __net export (13.9 TWh) is comparable to household consumption (15.1 TWh) and exceeds the consumption of the tertiary sector, including transport (13.2 TWh)__. The net export is also higher than, for example, the annual production at the two largest lignite-fired power plants in the country. The corresponding emissions (using the average coefficient for the Czech energy mix, see the methodology described below) correspond to approximately half of the emissions from passenger car transport in the Czech Republic. Moreover, net electricity exports have been increasing again since 2015<!--(see page 32, [ERO: Annual Report on the Operation of the EC of the Czech Republic 2018](http://www.eru.cz/documents/10540/4580207/Rocni_zprava_provoz_ES_2018.pdf/))-->). __The Czech Republic is generally one of the leading electricity exporters in the world, with Czech exports outpacing, for example, those of the People's Republic of China, which is many times larger__ (see [data for 2016](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=82) or [data for 2018](http://www.worldstopexports.com/electricity-exports-country/)).

* End-user electricity consumption, which experienced a slight decline after 2008, has been growing steadily over the last five years<!-- (see page 12, [ERO: Annual Report on the Operation of the EC of the Czech Republic 2018]http://www.eru.cz/documents/10540/4580207/Rocni_zprava_provoz_ES_2018.pdf/))-->. __Last year, end-user consumption recorded its highest values in the whole period under review since 1983__. The largest increase was recorded at the high and very high voltage levels, i.e. for the more energy-intensive operations. On the other hand, consumption decreased for households and small businesses<!--, see the analysis of [TZB-info](https://energetika.tzb-info.cz/elektroenergetika/19020-spotreba-elektriny-byla-v-roce-2018-nejvyssi-za-cele-sledovane-obdobi)-->. The industrial sector accounts for the largest share of consumption (30.7%), followed by households (24.7%) and the trade, services, education and health sector (20.5%).

## Methodology used and origin of data

* To calculate emissions, we used data on gross electricity production by individual types of power plants or fuels used from the annual report on the operation of the Czech electricity system in 2018<!--[ERO: Annual Report on the Operation of the EC of the Czech Republic 2018](http://www.eru.cz/documents/10540/4580207/Rocni_zprava_provoz_ES_2018.pdf/)-->. Based on these data, we calculated the corresponding emissions using the relevant IPCC coefficients ([IPCC 2014: ANNEX III, Technology-specific Cost and Performance Parameters](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf)). for its uniformity and data availability from different sources. For example, the authors of the [ElectricityMap](https://www.electricitymap.org/map?lang=en) project used a similar approach.
* We have merged some of the data for simplicity and clarity. For example, the entry "Biomass power plants" includes production from biomass-fired power plants and electricity production from biogas. The item "Hydroelectric power plants" includes both production from hydroelectric and pumped storage power plants, etc.
* The selected emission factors represent the mean value of the _"lifecycle emissions"_, including the emissions associated with the related infrastructure required to operate the respective sources. An example of the lifecycle emissions shown in the overview is the non-zero emissions for nuclear power plants.
* The item "Losses" includes technological self-consumption of energy sources, losses in the network of the transmission system operator, losses in the networks of individual distribution system operators, consumption of pumped storage power plants and the balance difference.
* The individual consumption categories are divided into the relevant sectors of the national economy according to their main <!--[-->CZ-NACE<!--](https://nacev2.com/en)--> code. <!--Details of this breakdown can be found in the relevant ERO Interpretative Opinion ([ERO Interpretative Opinion No 8/2018](http://www.eru.cz/documents/10540/3687211/Vykladove+stanovisko_ERU_8_2018.pdf/91a9c5ec-a0bd-48bf-a9a1-9da63c6a7ec9)). The item "Other" then includes local consumption of electricity producers (supply to own company or installation). -->
