While _Atlas klimatické změny_ focused on Czech readers, the English version needs to be relevant for a different audience. Hence, it is more than just a translated booklet – **some of the infographics and accompanying texts were replaced**. For example, the graph showing greenhouse gas emissions in Czechia between 1990 and 2021 was replaced by a similar graph showing GHG emissions in the European Union from 1990 to 2021.

What did NOT change was our approach – every piece of information provided in the _Atlas of Climate Change_ comes from **reliable public and transparent sources** (e.g. NASA, NOAA and Eurostat), and from renowned scientific journals (Nature, Science, etc.). Short links to the original sources are provided directly in the graphs and maps; original articles and datasets used for calculations are available in Czech at [faktaoklimatu.cz](https://faktaoklimatu.cz).

## What will you find inside?

1. **Introduction to climate change** – what it is all about and why global warming above 1.5 °C is a problem
2. **Concentrations of carbon dioxide** – how these concentrations were changing in the past and how they oscillate around the year
3. **Temperature changes** – how different areas on Earth are warming at different speed and why the warming in the 20th century is so fast
4. **How warming is related to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations** – this section includes information about research history of greenhouse effect, the concept of carbon budget and emission pathways related to the Paris Agreement
5. **Greenhouse gas emissions in global context** – what has changed since 1990, what emissions are produced in different sectors (and how these can be reduced), what is net-zero and which countries have pledged to it
6. **Other sources of reliable information on climate change** – a list of inspiring books and useful websites

## Need more? 

Since the booklet was first published in 2020, our team has created a number of **other  useful materials that are not included in the booklet**. These typically address more specific issues and provide greater detail. 

However, the majority of these materials are currently only available in Czech. Should you need the English version of any of them, please consider supporting us and contact us at [info@faktaoklimatu.cz](mailto:info@faktaoklimatu).
