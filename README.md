# Facts on climate

_Facts on climate_ started as a volunteer initiative in 2019 and has become an NGO in October 2020. Throughout the volunteer phase the initiative has created about 40 infographics covering many aspects of climate change (temperature and emissions data, energy, future scenarios, adaptation and mitigation measures) and summaries of selected international reports and studies. Due to the high visual quality of our work, many of the published materials were adopted by major Czech and Slovak media. _Fakta o klimatu_ received an award for Communication of Global Climate Change in October 2020 awarded by Czech Learned Society and Czech UN office.

Distinguishing features of our products:

* High class visuals that convey meaning of the data, tested for comprehensibility.
* Vector graphics in creative commons license that can be easily adjusted to graphical style of outlet,
* We also provide consultation of interpretation and context for journalists and policymakers.

## Mission

**Changing how people talk and think about climate change and climate policies.**

The project _Facts on climate_ aims to change the narrative landscape and enhance the quality of discussion about climate change issues and possible solutions among interested public and policymakers by creating data visualizations related to climate change, energy, emissions etc. and thus anchoring the discussion in facts. These visualizations are further used by journalists and teachers or become part of argumentation for sustainable policies by businesses.
