caption:       "This study by BloombergNEF explores how much the Czech electricity generation industry could change by 2030. It provides the most cost-effective scenario, based on the form of emission allowances valid at the time and not including any political interventions that might increase the carbon prices in the future. The study shows that the scenario with the lowest total costs also significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
