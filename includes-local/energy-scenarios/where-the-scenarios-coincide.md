### Where the scenarios coincide

[All of these scenarios](/topics/energy) show that a significant **shift away from coal as a primary source of electricity is feasible**, or that the barriers to such a shift are not at the level of security of supply or transmission system stability. Potential barriers may remain at the level of inferior distribution network infrastructure, investment allocation, human resources, legislation or the will to change.

The scenarios also do not envisage large-scale development of electricity storage** or green hydrogen generation by 2030 in their main variants.

The scenarios are also consistent in **installed capacity of nuclear and hydropower plants**. These sources have a long construction process and therefore none of the scenarios expect substantial changes by 2030. The expansion of the Dukovany plant will not be completed until 2036 at the earliest (if at all). Similarly, no substantial hydropower plant can be expected in the next decade, with some scenarios foreseeing a moderate development in small hydropower.
