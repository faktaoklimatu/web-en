caption:       "As declared in the Paris Agreement, we need to make sure that the mean global temperature does not rise well beyond the 1.5°C limit. One of the main reasons why this effort is so important is the risk of exceeding the “tipping points”: with the global warming of 2°C and higher, many large ecosystems on the planet are highly likely to exceed their tipping point – experience irreversible changes and eventually collapse."
